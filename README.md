## Assumptions
1. File recursion beyond a limit will cause an error to prevent memory overload
2. Running quit inside a script will exit the script, not the shell
3. The command "set bobbie Montreal Canadians", is computed as bobbie=Montreal
4. $ sign only shows when using the command line prompt to enter a command.
5. If running a script of commands, only output of the script will be printed with no $ signs.
6. program supports manually entering commands, piping commands from a script file and running a script file.
